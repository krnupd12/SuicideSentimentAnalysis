Farmers don't receive redundancy packages either, just debt, hardship, family distress and often depression and suicide. Life's easy in the city, farmers are forgotten.][994656290482761728, @RedFiveKFF @warriorloverlei First Ryan, thanks so much for your service (sincerely.)

Second it's a good dialogue - you and your wife have good hearts. Everyone talking to Leilani here seems to mean well.

I've lost 3 friends to suicide and struggle with bouts of massive depression myself. No 'sides' here.][994644574537596928, @jonrosenberg @iAmTheWarax a friend of mine in the Guard recently committed suicide. It was a total shock to everyone who knew him. I‚Äôd known him for years and had no clue he suffered from depression and was seeing a therapist. He left behind his wife and 2 kids, both under 10 :(][994632999676334080, @VABVOX I have an up close and personal relationship with depression and suicide. My first serious attempt was at age 19, first year in college. I hated EVERYTHING about it. A friend figured out I was up to something, showed up at my door. He refused to leave me alone for 3 days.][994516580066246656, @Jae_Day6 I highly recommend "Once Were Warriors". Its based in New Zealand and focuses on a dysfunctional family and tackles issues like domestic abuse, depression and suicide. There are 3 books in the series but sadly the third is very rare. But the stories are deep and emotional.][994452763282214912, Always look out for your family &amp; friends, you never know what is going on behind that smile üò¢ # depression #suicide][994423208140001281, Drug addiction anxiety depression and suicide thoughts are a disease which the Media and America aren‚Äôt taking seriously anymore Parents and family members take your time to sit down with your loved ones and ask them how they feel or what‚Äôs going onüíØ‚úäüèæ #SuicideAwareness][994406537320804352, #Repost @charliehunnaminternational with @get_repost To our SOA family members, Today, we lost a young teenage life to the tragedy of suicide.

Welcome all.
My first tweet.
I‚Äôm 18, living a great life, having a wonderful girlfriend to live it with.
And yet, I still want to die, Answers as to why?][992649348898017281, My girlfriend calling my phone
Ain't seen her in about a week
This depression got me weak
Ever wake up every day and you want to die?
Yes!
Life going good can't figure out why
Blank walls all around me keep the pills nearby
Player with the nine, then I close my eyes
